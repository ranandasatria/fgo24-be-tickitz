# Tickitz Backend API

A full-featured cinema ticket booking RESTful API built with Go (Gin), PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication. This project supports user registration, movie management, ticket purchasing, profile editing, and role-based access control for admins. It uses a modular architecture, Redis caching, and Swagger documentation.

## Features
- User registration, login, profile edit, and password reset
- Role-based access: admin & regular user
- Admin movie management (create, update, delete, assign genres/directors/casts)
- View all movies, upcoming, and now showing (with search + Redis cache)
- Payment method creation (admin)
- Transaction flow: book tickets with movie, time, seat, and payment method
- JWT-based authentication & authorization
- Swagger documentation ready


## Tech Stack
- Go (Gin) for backend framework
- PostgreSQL with pgx driver
- Redis for caching GET requests
- JWT for secure authentication
- Swagger (via swaggo/swag) for API docs
- Docker-ready (optional)
